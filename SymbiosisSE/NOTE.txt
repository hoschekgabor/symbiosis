This code will not compile correctly when running ‘make’, because some rules are missing.

One way to circumvent this problem is to copy the following “Release+Asserts” folder from CLAP’s built version of klee:
- runtime/Intrinsic/Release+Asserts/
- runtime/klee-libc/Release+Asserts/
- runtime/POSIX/Release+Asserts/ 

TODO: correct this!!
